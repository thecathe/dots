# dots

> need to finish these.. and automate some stuff. something about `.zshrc`? idk


# todo for maintainer
-[ ] allow user to add custom commit message when backing up
-[ ] add functionality for refreshing local files with those from `dots`
-[ ] add functionality to mark files for deletion (both repo and local system)
-[ ] ability to mark different versions of the same file for different setups (e.g., laptop and pc have different versions of a file?)
-[ ] ability to mark whole directories to be automatically backed up
-[ ] overhaul user "interaction" (currently just `press any key to continue...` which allows the user to cancel before proceeding.)

# todo in general
-[ ] overhaul rc.lua
-[ ] figure out how to export (?) `run_dot_manager.sh` for easier backups.
